To find this on windows simply go to your file explorer and enter %HomePath% into the address bar then press \\[ENTER\\]. If you would like to save this folder in your quick access toolbar, simply drag the folder icon found in the top left next to the address bar to the text 'Quick Access' there should be a small tooltip pop-up that tells you releasing the mouse while in that position will add the current directory to your quick access.\n",

Navigate back to your home directory using the methods described above then right click and select new folder, name it whatever you like then go back to your jupyter notebook session, find the folder on the homepage, open it and then in the top right corner select new->notebook this will create a new untitled notebook in the folder you just created. \n",

    "## Overview of Data Types in Python\n",
    "You may have seen code for other languages in the past where variables need to be assigned a certain type and cannot change from that type throughout the program's execution. In python we can throw all of that out the window because variable types are determined at runtime by the interpreter. This doesn't mean there aren't data types in python, it just means they take a back seat when you are programming. For the most part you won't find many times where the data type of your variables matters at all. The following python code shows variables being initialized with a literal of the specified type to give you an idea of what each is. As a side note, comments in code are very useful and important in python comments are denoted using the '#' symbol. A comment in any programming language is text or code that will not be run by the compiler or interpreter, this basically means anything you put after a '#' on the same line doesn't get run."

    "A demonstration of defining a function is shown in the following cell, python naming convention is to name variables and functions using snake_case where the _ is used to separate words. Additionally in the following example I have used a couple additional math functions that may be useful in your programs. If you ever wish to use another python module all you need to do is import it at the top of your file. In this case I've imported the math library which is built-in to python.

For any statements like these, the first if() conditional is evaluated first, if it is found to be true then the function do_something() will be executed and 'end of if/elif/else' will be printed. The other statements are not evaluated because the first if() was true. if the if() conditional is false, the conditional in the elif() statement will be evaluated. In this case if the elif() statement is true, the do_something_else() function will be evaluated followed by 'end of if/elif/else' being printed. If the elif() statement is also false then the code under the else: will be run. The else statement captures any cases where all previous if/elif statements returned false. It is also important to note there is no limit on the number of elif() statements you have before the else: but it is good practice to always have an else statement even if the else only prints an error. The following code demonstrates how if/elif/else statements may be used in a program. "

A very basic implementation of a for loop will print the iterating variable to show the loop executing. This can be found in the following example. Many programming languages use a different format than python for for loops, if you have prior programming experience you may be more familiar with for loops of the following style.\n",

    "Python's for loops are designed to use short syntax for any use of the loop. If you wish to iterate over a range of numbers you can use the `range(min, max)` function. The range function takes two parameters, the minimum value and maximum value. It's important to know that the minimum is included, but the maximum is excluded. This means in practice if you were to run `range(0, 3)` the returned range would be `[0, 1, 2]`. If you wish to iterate over a list simply replace the `range()` function call with the name of your list. These examples can also be found in the following code cells."

An example using the function is shown below.\n",

    "There is an additional type of while loop that utilizes an else statement following the code inside the loop. I've chosen to omit it from this tutorial because in the vast majority of scenarios it is not necessary. In case you do ever encounter one of these being used, the code under the `else:` statement is run when the loop ends. Now you might think well \"why wouldn't I just write that code after the while loop?\" And I would completely agree with you. The while else loop is only really useful if you want to ensure some code still gets run in the even the initial condition for the loop fails immediately. Suppose you are setting up variables and files for a program inside a while loop but for some reason the condition to begin the loop is not met, in this case the code after the loop may be utilizing things initialized inside of the loop, to avoid errors you could add an `else:` case to the end of the loop to ensure these still are initialized before the program continues.

    "## Dealing With Errors\n",
    "One of the most valuable assets when you are coding is Google. Specifically stack overflow will likely already have a post with answers discussing how to fix your specific issue. Python's error messages are some of the best as far as programming languages go. The steps I usually take in figuring out an issue with my code are listed below, I will stress that literally nobody that codes remembers how to do everything. You'll definitely get used to basic syntax and functions that you use frequently, but there will be a lot of stuff you'll need to look up and google is an amazing resource for this. If you're having trouble with a specific error, try searching `[your operating system] python [error]` you'll more than likely get thousands if not hundreds of thousands of results and 9 times out of 10 the first one is a stack overflow question with a bunch of helpful answers. If you don't immediately know what the issue is from the error message I highly recommend you immediately go to google. Sometimes trying to change things that you think *might* be the problem just adds to the list of errors. Anyway the following flow chart is the best visual aide I've found for how to approach errors in your code.\n",

    "# 1.8 Installing Additional Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Python libraries are quite easy to install on any platform. All you need to do is find the appropriate package you want for this guide I'll be installing Django which is a python library for web development. The installation process is the same no matter what package you are installing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pip is the package manager system that python uses, in order to install any packages you'll need to use pip. Luckily for you, since Python 3 released pip is already included when you install python to your system. Now onto installing right? It's super easy and the same whether you are on Windows/Mac/Unix. Note that you should not include the `< >` when executing this command yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install < package_name > \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I want to install Django I can locate the package on pip's dedicated website [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), for Django the package information can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/Django/). If you clicked the second link to see what Django's page looks like you probably noticed in the top left of the page it conveniently reminds you what command to use to install the package. In case you ever try to copy and paste this command it's helpful to know in most terminal and command prompt systems you'll need to use the shortcut `[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [C]` to copy and `[CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [V}` to paste. Generally the shortcut `[CTRL] + [C]` is used to end a running process in your terminal/command prompt. So now that we know the name of the package that the pip command will recognize is `Django` we can run the following command to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install Django\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error on a Mac/Unix system I would recommend running the same command with `sudo` prefixed to it. Sudo tells the computer you want to run the following command as an administrator which gives you the ability to install things in protected directories. It's important to note using sudo will require you to enter your password. For the most part when entering passwords on terminal/command prompt applications the usual feedback you're used to seeing such as the dots for each character you enter are not displayed, that doesn't mean it isn't paying attention to what you type, just type your password and when you finish press `[ENTER] or [RETURN]` if you're password was entered incorrectly it will ask you to enter it again and if everything checks out it will begin downloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo pip3 install Django\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I've included a short list of some python libraries you might be interested in. The links are for their PyPi pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "[PsychoPy](https://pypi.org/project/PsychoPy/)\n",
    "[Expy](https://pypi.org/project/expy/)\n",
    "[experiment_resources](https://pypi.org/project/experiment_resources/)\n",
    "[pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might be thinking ok cool I've got the package installed but now how do I use it? First there are two main ways of telling python you are using code from a specific package you have installed. The first of the two examples below imports a specific feature or group of features from the full package you installed. For big libraries like Django this is necessary because importing the entire library would be inefficient when only a small percentage of the available functions are actually being used. For a smaller niche library that only performs a few functions you can import it using the second example. In this case as we discussed the entire package and all the associated functions are imported together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from [package_name] import [module]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import [package_name] as [variable_name]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If I wanted to write a small program working with numpy and pandas I would import these packages like the second example. An important note about the `as` keyword is that it is not required, however for packages with really long names it is nice to be able to reference them with a less wordy variable. The following examples all complete the same function but with different methods of importing, take a look and take note of the advantages and disadvantages of each. I personally prefer the 3rd example for most use cases because it limits the amount you have to type, just be wary that no variable names in your program are the same as the variable names you set in the import statements."
