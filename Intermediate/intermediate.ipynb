    "# 2.1 Printing and Debugging\n",
    "If you already read through all of the beginner section you've seen me use the `print()` function a lot. Printing is a really good way to get feedback from your program as the code executes, sometimes you can't quite track down where an error is coming from with the printed error message and other times it will be a logic error you need to fix. Generally speaking when it comes to code logic errors are your worst enemy because it isn't something the python interpreter can catch. A common example of a logic error is if you programmed a banking system and the function which applies interest to an account uses the wrong equation the program will run just fine but customers' account balances will be incorrect. So how would you track down an issue? The best answer is a whole lot of printing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now as with most things in programming there's a number of ways of adding all these print statements to your code, I'll be showing a few ways that I commonly debug my programs as well as give a little blurb about when I would use each method but to be clear there is no *wrong* way to debug a program, if it helps you find the error and fix it then it's as good an options as any of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the code, I think it's also important to discuss what you should be printing in these debug statements. Generally speaking starting with printing the value of important variables. Additionally its sometimes useful to print something like `inside for loop` to help keep track of where in the code the program is currently executing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When debugging a program there are often a few things that affect what method I choose for adding debug statements. If its a large project I often elect to use the first example, this is a more permenant debugging solution that requires a bit more initial setup but can be useful when problems pop up because only the debug variable's value needs to be changed for the print statements to work. For small projects this is a bit overkill because its likely you will fix the problem and not need to debug that part of the code again. Now lets get into some code shall we?"

    "Being able to read and write files using python code will certainly help improve your workflow when you're working with real data. In addition to the basic methods I've provided here there are also many, many libraries which include functions to read in and format data into useful structures as well as output python data structures into various file formats.

Reading the file means that python will be able to use data in the file as the code executes but no new content can be added to the file nor can any content be removed. Writing the file refers to making changes to the content of the file whether that's adding new information or removing existing information. Although you could always open a file with both read and write privledges, it is better to have it only open with what you intend so that nothing accidentally gets overwritten or deleted. The following table shows the various modes available, the parameter you would use, and a short description of what they do.\n",

    "Now that we know how to open a file, let's try doing some reading and writing. If you look at the table above you'll notice the text mode is the default, for your purposes you'll really only be using text mode this means when content is read from the file you've opened all of it will be in string format to begin with, this is important to remember if you are working with data because python will not automatically parse the data into numbers that you can perform mathematical equations on. The binary mode on the other hand reads the bytes of data in your file directly without attempting to interpret it. This means if you had a file with a single `a` reading the file in binary mode would return `01100001` which is the binary representation of the ASCII 'a'. In contrast if you read the same file in text mode the returned value would be `'a'` (Note: apostrophes and quotation marks are interchangable in python, both denote a string literal)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from a file\n",
    "If you want to read the entire contents of the file in all at once you can use `file_contents = file_object.read()` this calls the read() function on the file which you opened using the `open()` function we discussed earlier. In many cases reading the entire file in one giant blob is not the best way to accomplish any given task which is why there are other reading methods and functions available. In some instances it may be better for each line in the file to be a separate string. We can get a list of all the lines in separate strings using `file_lines = file_object.readlines()` which will return a list with each entry being its own line in the file. The final option for file reading is the `readline()` function. This function reads a single line at a time and returns it as a string. This function is best used with a loop so that you can incrementally read and process each line from a file rather than trying to do it all at once. Before we take a look at the code in the next cell and see some working code we need to cover the `close()` function. It is critical (if you don't want to have corrupted files) to close the file when you are done using it, if it helps you can think of it like saving your work before you shutdown your computer, if you don't save your work it won't all be there when you return. To close a file object all you need to do is `file_object.close()`. Alternatively, you can avoid needing to remember to include the `close()` statement by using a little python magic with the `with` keyword. The following example creates a file named `data.txt` and writes `hello world` then automatically closes the file when all writing has completed.\n",

    "with open('data.txt', 'x+') as file:\n",

    "## Writing to a file\n",
    "As you saw in an example for reading files, writing files is super easy. There's only one command you need and that is `write()`. The example you saw earlier used a string literal `'Hello World'` but you can also pass variables into it too. You'll likely want to format the data you are writing to a file in some way which means you'll need to make use of escape characters. Escape characters are basically a combination of symbols and letters which tells the python interpreter to treat it like a type of white space. If you wanted a new line to be added after your sentence you'd want to add a `\\n` to the end of the string. Similarly, if you wanted to add a tab in between two numbers you would use a `\\t`. For a full list of escape characters in python look [here](http://python-ds.com/python-3-escape-sequences)."

    "# 2.3 String Manipulation\n",
    "By now you've seen quite a few examples using functions available to strings in python. Earlier in this section we used the `format()` function to insert variables in place of `{}` and in the example parsing numbers from a file we used the `rstrip()` function to remove the `\\n` from the last number in the line. To understand strings better we first need to look at how python interprets them. In python a string is a list of characters with a particular order. This means if you wanted to get just the 'w' from the string `'hello world'` you could access it like a list (remember that the first item in a list is found at index 0) so something like the following example would return only the w from the string.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_str = 'hello world'\n",
    "only_w = my_str[6]\n",
    "# starting with index 0 count each letter including whitespace and you'll find the 'w' at index 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because strings are secretly lists we can also use the `len()` function to get the length of the string, this is often useful if you are looping over a string's characters in search of something specific this way you can set up your for loop similar to the one below:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_str = 'abcdefg'\n",
    "for i in range(len(my_str)):\n",
    "    print(my_str[i])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Or alternatively you could just loop over the string like we did with lists:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_str = 'zxywvu'\n",
    "for character in my_str:\n",
    "    print(character)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Seems pretty straightforward right? Let's take a look at some new functions we haven't messed with along with some examples for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to count the number of occurences of a certain character or pattern of characters you should use the `count()` function. The only parameter you need to pass to this function is the character(s) you are trying to count. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = ' a a b a b b a a b a'\n",
    "s.count('a')   # returns 6\n",
    "s.count('b')   # returns 4\n",
    "s.count(' ')   # returns 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to find the index of a letter or word you can use the `find()` function. Much like the `count()` function, the only argument you need is what you are trying to find. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = 'hello world'\n",
    "s.find('w')    # returns 6 \n",
    "s[6]           # returns w\n",
    "s.find('world') # also returns 6 because that is the index of the first character of the pattern that matches\n",
    "s.find('burger') # returns -1 because burger is not in the string 'hello world'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to get part of a string from a bigger string you'll need to slice it. At first slicing seems complicated and confusing but its fairly simple. The following table will help show the different ways you can slice a string depending on what information you have and what information you need. In the table we assume the string you are slicing is stored in the variable named 's'.\n",

    "|`s[:end]`     | returns all content from the beginning of the string until end-1 index             |\n",
    "|`s[:]`        | returns the entire string as a copy                                                |\n",

    "world = s[6:]   # returns 'world'\n",
    "hello_world = s[:]  # returns 'hello world'\n",
    "o_w = s[4:7]    # returns 'o w'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it would be more useful to split a string depending on a certain delimeter, for this we use the `split()` function which takes the delimeter you are splitting the string by as a parameter. For example if you had a list of numbers separated by commas and wanted to split each into their own string you could use `my_string.split(',')` which would return a list of strings.\n",
