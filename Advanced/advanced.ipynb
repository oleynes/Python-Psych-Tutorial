    "# 3.1 Abstraction and Why Its Actually Useful\n",
    "Before we get into these advanced concepts I just wanted to leave a note here that you can likely get away without ever using any of these, python is both an object oriented language and a scripting language which gives you the versatility to use it as you need it and ignore the features that you don't need. Now that being said just because you *can* do something doesn't always mean that's the best or most efficient way to do it. If you've been following this guide through the last two sections and are feeling comfortable with the concepts presented there then you are probably ready to look at the fancier stuff you can do. \n",

    "Abstraction is at a very basic level a way to make code that can be reused in many different programs that do different things. Abstraction uses objects which encapsulate a specific function or purpose into something someone else could use in their own software without needing to know how your code is programmed. This is especially useful when you have multiple people working on a project together, you can show the other people in your team the functions available through your code and they can use that for their own portions. In order for you to be able to leverage these tools to your advantage we need to start at the basics first. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of an object in programming much like an object in the physical world, take for example a hammer, it has a variety of functions available to it but you don't need to know how to pour the hot iron into a mold and attach the handle in order to use the hammer, you just go to Home Depot or Lowes and buy yourself one. That's pretty much how objects in programming work too. Let's say you're trying to program a little simulation where a ball bounces of the corners of your screen and moves around on its own. You could have a bunch of independent variables tracking the x position, y position, velocity and such but the more features you try to add to the program the more difficult it will be to maintain what is happening at any given time. The following code snippet shows how you might set up your variables for this single ball bouncing around your screen. In the following example you'll notice how many variables you'll need to keep track of if you wanted to have 2 balls bouncing around instead of 1. Obviously you aren't here to learn how to write programs simulating the bouncing of balls, the point of this exercise is to demonstrate how hard it becomes to keep things clean and efficient when you start adding more and more features. With an object oriented approach you could accomplish the same task with a lot less code and with the ability to quickly add as many balls to your screen as you want. The third code snippet will give you an idea of how classes are setup and how you can use the power of object oriented programming to get the computer to do the legwork for you rather than hardcoding all of it yourself.\n",

    "Now that you hopefully see why objects can be worth the trouble, let's look the anatomy of a class and what all that stuff about self means. The following example can be used to help you get a visual for what I am describing. To define an object in python you need the keyword `class` followed by the name of your class/object followed by a `:`. Not all classes you come across will follow this exact structure but that is related to class inheritance which is a topic we will discuss in a later portion of this section. Now inside your class you have lots of options, you can define variables directly inside the class, these are often referred to as class variables because when an object of this type is constructed those variables will have the same value to begin with no matter which object you are looking at. Next you have your class constructor which is a special type of function which is called when you create an object of this type. So in the previous example with balls the `Ball(0, 0, 1, 1)` passes those parameters to the constructor defined by the `__init__()` function in the Ball class. The use of the `self` keyword in the constructor's function code tells python we are making an instance variable and setting it to the given value. Instance variables are separate from class variables because they won't always be the same when an object is first created. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    # Class constructor - this is the function that gets called when you create an object of this type\n",
