    "# 3.1 Abstraction and Why Its Actually Useful\n",
    "Before we get into these advanced concepts I just wanted to leave a note here that you can likely get away without ever using any of these, python is both an object oriented language and a scripting language which gives you the versatility to use it as you need it and ignore the features that you don't need. Now that being said just because you *can* do something doesn't always mean that's the best or most efficient way to do it. If you've been following this guide through the last two sections and are feeling comfortable with the concepts presented there then you are probably ready to look at the fancier stuff you can do. \n",

    "Abstraction is at a very basic level a way to make code that can be reused in many different programs that do different things. Abstraction uses objects which encapsulate a specific function or purpose into something someone else could use in their own software without needing to know how your code is programmed. This is especially useful when you have multiple people working on a project together, you can show the other people in your team the functions available through your code and they can use that for their own portions. In order for you to be able to leverage these tools to your advantage we need to start at the basics first. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of an object in programming much like an object in the physical world, take for example a hammer, it has a variety of functions available to it but you don't need to know how to pour the hot iron into a mold and attach the handle in order to use the hammer, you just go to Home Depot or Lowes and buy yourself one. That's pretty much how objects in programming work too. Let's say you're trying to program a little simulation where a ball bounces of the corners of your screen and moves around on its own. You could have a bunch of independent variables tracking the x position, y position, velocity and such but the more features you try to add to the program the more difficult it will be to maintain what is happening at any given time. The following code snippet shows how you might set up your variables for this single ball bouncing around your screen. In the following example you'll notice how many variables you'll need to keep track of if you wanted to have 2 balls bouncing around instead of 1. Obviously you aren't here to learn how to write programs simulating the bouncing of balls, the point of this exercise is to demonstrate how hard it becomes to keep things clean and efficient when you start adding more and more features. With an object oriented approach you could accomplish the same task with a lot less code and with the ability to quickly add as many balls to your screen as you want. The third code snippet will give you an idea of how classes are setup and how you can use the power of object oriented programming to get the computer to do the legwork for you rather than hardcoding all of it yourself.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that you hopefully see why objects can be worth the trouble, let's look the anatomy of a class and what all that stuff about self means. The following example can be used to help you get a visual for what I am describing. To define an object in python you need the keyword `class` followed by the name of your class/object followed by a `:`. Not all classes you come across will follow this exact structure but that is related to class inheritance which is a topic we will discuss in a later portion of this section. Now inside your class you have lots of options, you can define variables directly inside the class, these are often referred to as class variables because when an object of this type is constructed those variables will have the same value to begin with no matter which object you are looking at. Next you have your class constructor which is a special type of function which is called when you create an object of this type. So in the previous example with balls the `Ball(0, 0, 1, 1)` passes those parameters to the constructor defined by the `__init__()` function in the Ball class. The use of the `self` keyword in the constructor's function code tells python we are making an instance variable and setting it to the given value. Instance variables are separate from class variables because they won't always be the same when an object is first created. The remainder of the class will be made up of your member functions, member functions should be restricted to only do functions that the overall object is intended to handle. This means if you were making a hammer class you wouldn't have a function for getting more wood in your hammer class because the wood is an independent object. When a class does depend objects outside of the class's encapsulation this is called a dependency. It's important to maintain as much separation and encapsulation as possible so that your object is easily reused in other programs without the need to make adjustments. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning it is common practice to keep class definitions in a separate python file and then import the classes as needed rather than defining them in the same file as your primary logic for your program. This also helps if you plan to reuse the code because you can simply import from the file rather than moving all your old program logic somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClassName:\n",
    "    # Class variables will start the same no matter what arguments you pass to the constructor\n",
    "    my_class_variable = 10\n",
    "    DEBUG = True\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Class constructor - this is the function that gets called when you create an object of this type\n",
    "    def __init__(self, arg1, arg2, ..., argN):\n",
    "        self.arg1 = arg1\n",
    "        self.arg2 = arg2\n",
    "        .\n",
    "        .\n",
    "        .\n",
    "        self.argN = argN\n",
    "        \n",
    "       # you can also define other instance variables without setting them equal to the value of a passed argument\n",
    "        self.my_other_arg = 'hello'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # additional member functions always take self as an argument, they can also be defined to take additional\n",
    "    # parameters as you see in my_other_func()\n",
    "    def my_func(self):\n",
    "        # do something\n",
    "    \n",
    "        \n",
    "    def my_other_func(self, a, b):\n",
    "        return a * b\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def my_last_func(self):\n",
    "        print(self.arg1)               # when referencing instance variables you'll need to use the self. prefix\n",
    "        print(str(my_class_variable))  # when referencing class variables you don't need the self. prefix\n",
    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So what's this stuff about self??\" You might still be thinking. The self keyword is used to tell the python interpreter it needs to look at the specific instance of the object to find the value of the variable. This means if you were to have two Ball objects you wouldn't want the `apply_velocity()` function to use the same `xpos` and `ypos` variables for both objects because you've set them to different values. The self tells python we are expecting the value of this variable to be different depending on the instance of the class. This is also why class variables do not need to be referenced using self because they generally should not change and are used to define relevant constants for the internal logic of the class. A good example of a class variable would be defining an approximate value for Pi when writing a Derivative class, pi often is used for calculating derivatives of certain mathematical functions so this would be a useful approximation to have, however we don't expect pi to be different depending on the instance of the class so it doesn't need to be an instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bonus feature of python which other programming languages don't often support is the ability to write a class with no constructor. If you have a bunch of similar functions you find youself reusing frequently, you can conveniently package them all into a class for easy imports then use them in any part of your code. An example of a class without constructor is below.\n",

    "# 3.2 Basic Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is another feature of classes built with the idea of minimizing repeat code. The idea is that if you had something like an online shop with lots of different items that might need different fields and values you wouldn't want to have to rewrite the price and name attributes for each item because every item will have those. This is where inheritance is useful. With inheritance you can create a base class which has all the instance variables that every variation of the base class needs to have. Going along with the item example you would likely have a base class named `Item` which has instance variables for `name`, `price`, and a `picture` then you might have a `ProduceItem` class which inherits the `name`, `price` and `picture` properties from the `Item` class. Then you could add an `expiration_date` instance variable because that would be specific to produce items. By having classes inherit from other classes it also makes them easier to work with when writing your program's main logic. In the example of items you could have a list of `Item` objects where some of them are `ProduceItem`, others are `ClothingItem` or `AccessoryItem` or whatever you need but the collection of all these items share one common ancestor the `Item` class. In addition to inheriting instance variables you can also define functions in the base class that are accessible to any of the subclasses. if your `Item` base class had a function `print_price()` then your `ProduceItem` class could call that function as well. Lastly with inherited functions it is sometimes useful to define a basic version of the function in the base class then override that function in a subclass to have logic specific to the instance variables and attributes of the subclass. The following example shows how this sort of inheritance would be implemented.\n",

    "# 3.3 Types of Inheritance\n",
    "In 3.2 we learned how to use basic inheritance (also known as single inheritance) this form of inheritance has a class inherit from only one superclass, however this is not the only way inheritance can work in python. The other types of inheritance we will be discussing in this section are multiple inheritance, multi-level inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, and hybrid inheritance. Multiple inheritance pretty much works exactly how you would expect, rather than having a class definition like `class ClothingItem(Item):` we could have something like `class DrinkItem(Item, ProduceItem)` so that not only are the `price`, `name`, and `picture` attributes inherited from the `Item` class but the `expiration` instance variable from the `ProduceItem` class is also inherited. This is a very basic example that you probably wouldn't implement in a real program because it makes the code more confusing than anything. In most real world cases multiple inheritance is implemented using something called mixins. Mixins can take many forms but are effectively a way to encapsulate some behavior such as logging a program's behvior throughout execution without reimplementing all of your classes. By creating one `LoggerMixin` that every class inherits from every class will have a `log()` function that can be invoked wherever it is needed these can be useful in some situations but in general the same problem can be solved with single inheritance. If you'd like to learn more about mixins I suggest reading [this](https://easyaspython.com/mixins-for-fun-and-profit-cb9962760556) guide.\n",
